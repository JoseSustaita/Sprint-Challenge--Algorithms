#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)

    Because with each iteration of the while loop is dependendet on the value of n. Will grow linear in porportion to the data inputed.

b) O(n^2)

    Because it involes a nested iteration over the dataset.

c) O(n)

    Because this is a recursive function it is dependent on when bunnies will = 0

## Exercise II

I would use a binary search algorithim and the runtime complexity for this would be O(logn)

This makes sense because you want to elimate half the floors right off the bat to find which floor is the highest point you can drop off an egg without breaking. Running this will get you the middle floor fast and then from there you can test if the eggs breaks above or below that.
